<p>Does it come in black?</p>

<p>Seven hundred twelve counts of extortion. Eight hundred and forty-nine counts of racketeering. Two hundred and forty-six counts of fraud. Eighty-seven counts of conspiracy murder.Five hundred and twenty-seven counts of obstruction of justice. How do the defendants plead?</p>

<p>Never start with the head. The victim gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next... See?</p>

<p>Or perhaps he's wondering why someone would shoot a man before throwing him out of the plane.</p>

<p>You want order in Gotham. Batman must take off his mask and turn himself in. Oh, and every day he doesn't, people will die. Starting tonight. I'm a man of my word.</p>

<p>Just you, sir? Don't worry, Master Wayne. It takes a little time to get back in the swing of things.</p>

<p>It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me.</p>

<p>Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages.</p>

<p>And as for the television's so-called plan, Batman has no jurisdiction.</p>

<p>Justice is about harmony. Revenge is about you making yourself feel better.</p>

<p>A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid.</p>

<p>Let me get this straight. You think that your client, one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world is secretly a vigilante who spends his nights beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands and your plan is to blackmail this person? Good luck.</p>

<p>How can you move faster than possible, fight longer than possible, without the most powerful impulse of the spirit? The fear of death.</p>

<p>You are in hell, little man. And I am the devil.</p>
