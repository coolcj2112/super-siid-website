<p>It all started with a kid too hyperactive to handle. Then instinctively, my parents put me into music. Hopeful that I would use music as an escape and form of expressing myself, they were relived to see how well I took to it. It was love at first touch. </p>

<p>The moment I touched the keys, I knew in an instant that this was something that I'm gonna do for the rest of my life. Some spend a whole lifetime looking for a release that is true to them. Something more on this Earth that allows them to stay true to who they are, and I found mine at the age of five.</p>

<p>This is something that's going to be a part of my life till the day I die, so make sure you embark on this journey early</p>
