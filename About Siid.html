<p>It's ends here.</p>

<p>I hope you're not a member of the fire brigade.</p>

<p>And as for the television's so-called plan, Batman has no jurisdiction.</p>

<p>You are in hell, little man. And I am the devil.</p>

<p>You have inspired good. But you spat in the faces of Gotham's criminals. Didn't you think there might be casualties? Things always get worse before they get better.</p>

<p>Just you, sir? Don't worry, Master Wayne. It takes a little time to get back in the swing of things.</p>

<p>But I know the rage that drives you. That impossible anger strangIing the grief until the memory of your loved one is just poison in your veins. And one day, you catch yourself wishing the person you loved had never existed so you'd be spared your pain.</p>

<p>Are you so desperate to fight criminals that you lock yourself in to take them on one at a time ?</p>

<p>Does it come in black?</p>

<p>Gotham's time has come.</p>

<p>Never start with the head. The victim gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next... See?</p>

<p>I just the took to calling it the Bat. And yes Mr. Wayne, it does come in black.</p>

<p>I just want my phone call.</p>

<p>Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area.</p>
