<p>Breathe in your fears. Face them. To conquer fear, you must become fear. You must bask in the fear of other men. And men fear most what they cannot see. You have to become a terrible thought. A wraith. You have to become an idea! Feel terror cloud your senses. Feel its power to distort. To control. And know that this power can be yours. Embrace your worst fear. Become one with the darkness.</p>

<p>Swear to me!</p>

<p>Okay. Now... Hardened Kevlar plates over titanium-dipped, tri-weave fibers for flexibility. You'll be lighter, faster, more agile.</p>

<p>You know how to fight six men. We can teach you how to engage 600.</p>

<p>Never start with the head. The victim gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next... See?</p>

<p>To manipulate the fears in others, you must first master your own. Are you ready to begin?</p>

<p>It means you're hatred, and it also means losing someone, who I've cared for since I first heard his cries echoing through this house. But it might also mean saving your life. And that is more important.</p>

<p>I'll be standing where l belong. Between you and the peopIe of Gotham.</p>

<p>This town deserves a better class of criminal and I'm gonna give it to them. Tell your men they work for me now. This is my city.</p>

<p>I hope you're not a member of the fire brigade.</p>

<p>I'm Gotham's reckoning. It'll end the ball of damns you've all been living on. A necessary evil.</p>

<p>Do you wanna know why I use a knife? Guns are too quick. You can't savor all the... little emotions. You see, in their last moments, people show you who they really are. So in a way, I knew your friends better than you ever did. Would you like to know which of them were cowards?</p>

<p>Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area.</p>

<p>Theatricality and deception, powerful agents to the uninitiated. But we are initiated aren't we, Bruce? Members of the League of Shadows. And you betrayed us.</p>
